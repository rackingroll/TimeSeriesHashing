\section{Conclusion and Future Works}

Calculating the correlation between different time series is an important data mining task. By using correlation method, we can find hidden relationships between different time series. 
However, in most real world problems, time series often have very different patterns (e.g. Periodical, Linear, random, etc.). And there also correlations between such heterogeneous time series, and the correlation between these time series is also a very import problem.
Despite their importance, there has been little previous work addressing the correlation between two types of heterogeneous time series data.

In this paper, we propose an approach that is capable of (1) evaluating evaluate the correlation between heterogeneous time series (time series with different patterns), and (2) dealing with very large top-k searching problems.
The experimental results on Synthetic data sets and real world data set show
the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.
