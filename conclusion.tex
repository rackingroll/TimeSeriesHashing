\section{Conclusion}

Measuring the correlation (or similarity) between different time series is an important data mining task. 
However, in most real world problems, time series often have very different patterns (e.g. Periodical, Linear, random, etc.). 
And these heterogeneous time series can also correlated with each other because they all change their behavior simultaneously.
Despite their importance, there has been little previous work addressing the correlation between two types of heterogeneous time series data.

In this paper, we propose an approach that is capable of (1) evaluating the correlation between heterogeneous time series (time series with different patterns), and (2)  Furthermore, our measure admits locality sensitive hashing (LSH) scheme, leading to efficient sub-linear search and clustering algorithms.
The experimental results on Synthetic data sets and real world data set show
the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.
