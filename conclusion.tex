\section{Conclusion and Future Works}

Calculating the correlation between different time series is an important data mining task. 
In recent years, time series data have two major properties: (1) Heterogeneity property (Different Time series may have different patterns.) and (2) High Dimensional and Large Scale. 
In addition, for heterogeneous time series with different pattern, they may also have high correlation. Despite their importance, there has been little previous work addressing the correlation between two types of heterogeneous time series data.

In this paper, we propose an approach that is capable of (1) evaluating evaluate the correlation between heterogeneous time series (time series with different patterns), and (2) dealing with very large scale problems.
We investigated a change based correlation Coefficient to evaluate the correlation between different heterogeneous time series. In addition, we proposed hashing based method to do fast searching and clustering on very large scale time series.
The experimental results on Synthetic data sets and real world data set show
the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.
