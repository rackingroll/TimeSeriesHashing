Measuring the correlation or similarity between different time series is a common prerequisite for time series mining tasks. 
However, in most real-world problems, time series often have different patterns (e.g. Periodical, Linear, random, etc.). 
And the correlation between these heterogeneous time series is also very meaningful.
However, despite their importance, there has been little previous work addressing the correlation between two types of heterogeneous time series data.

In this paper, we propose a change based correlation method that is capable of evaluating the correlation between heterogeneous time series. 
In addition, by taking the advantage of this correlation coefficient, we can do searching and mining on large scale time series datasets.
The experimental results on Synthetic data sets and real-world data sets show the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.
