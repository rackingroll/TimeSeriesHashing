Calculating the correlation between different time series is an important data mining task. By using correlation method, we can find hidden relationships between different time series. 
However, in most real-world problems, time series often have many different patterns (e.g. Periodical, Linear, random, etc.). And the correlation between these heterogeneous time series is also very meaningful.
Despite their importance, there has been little previous work addressing the correlation between two types of heterogeneous time series data.

In this paper, we propose a change based correlation method that is capable of evaluating evaluate the correlation between heterogeneous time series. In addition, by taking the advantage of this correlation coefficient, we propose to use LSH method to dealing with very large top-k searching problems.
The experimental results on Synthetic data sets and real-world data sets show
the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.
